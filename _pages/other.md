<!---   Aside from economics, I'm also into art. 
I minored in studio art back in college, and was interested in music and visual arts from the Romantic era to the early 20th century.
Sadly, I rarely painted after I started grad school due to time constraints, but I've been trying to pratice piano as much as I can:sweat_smile:!

Below are some of my paintings.
