<h3 class="archive__subtitle">Hi there!</h3>
I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Economics at Cornell University advised by [Francesca Molinari](https://molinari.economics.cornell.edu/). 
My research focuses on identification problems in causal inference and nonparametric methods.
Before graduate school, I received my B.S. in Mathematics and Economics with a minor in Studio Art from Tulane University.
